# The Story Behind Simple Snake

I made Simple Snake during the fall of 2020 for my second web development class.

The main reason behind this project was to start learning JavaScript and getting more comfortable with it.

This was a simple project, but I did get better at JavaScript because of it, and it was fun making a game that was similar to an iconic part of my childhood.

I would sometimes play the classic Snake on my parent's Nokia phone when I was young. And it felt nice trying to recreate that experience.

Of course, nothing will have quite the feel of the original, but you can try out Simple Snake using [this link](https://people.inf.elte.hu/gshkd4/pages/games/simple-snake/).

You can control the game with the arrow keys.
